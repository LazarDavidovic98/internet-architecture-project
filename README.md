# Internet Architecture Project

This project is a comprehensive simulation of an Internet-like network architecture implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. It involves routing, addressing, VLAN segmentation, and inter-AS communication.  
Goal was Implementation of a complete network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer with multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes), IPv4/IPv6 addressing, routing (static, OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, BGP), and VLAN configuration.

## Network Topology Overview

The view below shows the overall network topology of the project to be developed in Cisco Packet Tracer

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco 2901 Routers
- Cisco 2960 Switches
- IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
- Routing protocols: OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, BGP

## Network Design
- Autonomous Systems: AS 100nn, 200nn, 300nn, 400nn (ISP)
- IPv4 for all, IPv6 included only in AS 200nn
- VLANs for Development, Marketing, and Management
- Routing domains with internal and external routing protocols

## How to Run
1. Open `ai-project` using Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Verify routing tables and interfaces
3. Use CLI for testing connectivity (`ping`, `traceroute`, etc.)

## ðŸ“„ Documentation
Detailed explanation of addressing, routing configuration and design decisions can be found in [Documentation](doc/Documentation.md)  
Final report for this project can be found in [Report](doc/Report.pdf)
